How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
In a large file with multiple lines, it immediately points out where the differences are that you might ignore just viewing with your own eyes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You can revert back to any normal state as you want, after you modify your code and create some bugs accidentally. 
By comparing the two versions you find where the bugs might be more quickly.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
