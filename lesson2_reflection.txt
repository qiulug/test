How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermediate area between the working directory and the repository. It displays the files both in local directory and remote repository, pointing out the changes at the same time. It is a useful tool to see the differences, check the files and make sure you put everything where you want them to be.
